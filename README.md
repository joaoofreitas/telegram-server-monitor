# server-telegram-monitor
Small project, that I used to monitor my small RaspberryPi server, without SSH.
It needs some eficiency upgrades, but it's currently working.

Features:
1. Public IP Address Fetcher
2. Temperature Fetcher
3. Connected IP's list
4. Warning message on ssh login.

To do:
1. Add an installation
2. Performance Upgrade (even though is really fast).
